This project is a collection of interactive, dynamic web pages designed to support active learning. Each page provides engaging activities, such as matching games and other interactive exercises, to help participants better understand and retain educational content.

The goal of this project is to create accessible, user-friendly tools that enhance learning experiences and can be easily embedded into learning management systems or used as standalone web resources.
